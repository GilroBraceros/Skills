        <h2>SKILLS</h2>

        <p>  I've always been a sporty kid, I got into basketball play with my friends after school and develop a trait that when the game gets tough <b>I don't fold under pressure</b>.<sup>1</sup>

            When I was in high-school I've participated in barangay and district esports tournaments <b>developing my communication skill</b> enabling me to express my thoughts and ideas clearly<sup>6</sup>. 
            It also helped me become <b>more strategic</b> since every match requires planning and execution.<sup>7</sup> My <b>ability to analyze situations</b> improved as I played more competitive games.<sup>8</sup>

            It also improved my <b>leadership skills</b>, as sometimes I have to step up and make decisions for the team.<sup>13</sup> I became <b>more patient and understanding</b>, knowing that every teammate has strengths and weaknesses.<sup>14</sup>

            I also improved my <b>ability to prioritize tasks</b>, focusing on what needs to be done first.<sup>18</sup> Being organized helps me stay productive without feeling overwhelmed.<sup>19</sup> I make sure to keep track of my progress and adjust my schedule if necessary.<sup>20</sup>  
            Since I came from the province I can say that my <b>adaptation skills</b> improved enabling me to work in different environments.<sup>21</sup> Moving to different places helped me become more independent and resourceful.<sup>22</sup> 
            I learned how to <b>adjust to different cultures and lifestyles</b>, making me more open-minded.<sup>21</sup> It also made me more <b>observant</b>, allowing me to pick up on new things quickly.<sup>23</sup> I became more confident in facing new challenges, knowing that I can adapt and overcome obstacles. <sup>24</sup>

        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        <p>I fell in love with playing and watching <b>basketball</b> since I was a kid, same with playing <b>video games</b>, <b>watching movies</b>, and series, with the Marvel Cinematic Universe being my favorite franchise.<sup>1</sup> We have a rusty basketball ring outside our house where we always play after school.<sup>2</sup> Playing basketball with my friends became a daily routine, and we would stay outside until it got dark.<sup>3</sup> Sometimes, we even play under the rain just because we were having too much fun.<sup>4</sup> I remember how we used to bet <i>ice tubig</i> on whoever wins; it made the games even more intense.<sup>5</sup>
            Back in the province, I also liked to <b>ride a bicycle and </b>travel; I just enjoy seeing the greenery of the surroundings.<sup>6</sup> There’s something relaxing about biking through the fields, just enjoying the view.<sup>7</sup><B>Traveling</B> to different places also excites me, even if it's just nearby towns; I like discovering new spots.<sup>8</sup> I also like <b>photography</b>, I just take random pictures of things that I find interesting.<sup>9</sup> Most of the time, I take photos of sunsets, landscapes, and anything that looks aesthetically pleasing.<sup>10</sup> Photography makes me appreciate the little things around me that I usually ignore.<sup>11</sup>
            I also like listening to <b>music</b>, with hip-hop being my favorite genre.<sup>12</sup> With artists like Post Malone, Swae Lee, Kendrick Lamar, and locally like Kiyo, Allison Shore, Because, I enjoy how the beats and lyrics tell a story, and sometimes, I just vibe with the beat.<sup>13</sup> Music helps me focus when I’m working on something, and it also lifts my mood when I’m feeling down.<sup>14</sup> I sometimes listen to old-school hip-hop and R&B tracks because they have a different kind of energy compared to modern ones.<sup>15</sup> There are times when I just put on my earphones, lay down, and just listen to music for hours.<sup>16</sup>
            <b>Gaming</b> is also one of my favorite hobbies. I like playing competitive games where strategy and quick thinking are needed.<sup>17</sup> It makes me feel accomplished whenever I win a tough match or pull off a great play.<sup>18</sup> <b>Watching series</b> is another thing I enjoy, especially when I get hooked on a good storyline.<sup>19</sup> I can binge-watch an entire series if I really like it, and I don’t even notice how much time has passed.<sup>20</sup> I do like a good twist that makes me think deeply after an episode or even after a season.<sup>21</sup>
